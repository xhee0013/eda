# Numerical features of a single contiuous variables

```{r example-plot, fig.height = 1.3}
ggplot(some_df, aes(x1)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, fill = "pink", color = "black") + 
  theme_void() +

```


* A measure of **_central tendency_**, e.g. mean, median and mode.
* A measure of **_dispersion_** (also called variability or spread), e.g. variance, standard deviation and interquartile range.
* There are other measures, e.g. **_skewness_** and **_kurtosis_** that measures "tailedness", but these are not as common as the measures of first two. 
* The mean is also the _first moment_ and variance, skewness and kurtosis are _second, third, and fourth central moments_. 
* **Significance tests** or **hypothesis tests**: When testing for $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ vs. $H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$ (often $\mu_0 = 0$), the $t$-test is commonly used if the underlying data are believed to be normally distributed.
---


# Outliers

.info-box[
**Outliers** are *observations* that are significantly different from the majority.
]

<br>

* Outliers can occur by chance in almost all distributions, but could be indicative of a measurement error, a different population, or an issue with the sampling process.
* Outlying values of independent variables are referred to as **high-leverage points**, although this distinction is not particularly important when analysing a single continuous variable.


---


# Closer look at the _boxplot_


```{r annotated-boxplot, fig.height = 3}
fn <- quantile(mtcars$wt, c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), type = 7)
iqr <- fn[4] - fn[2]
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, "")) + 
  geom_boxplot(size = 1.4, width = 0.2, outlier.color = "#006DAE",
               outlier.size = 3, outlier.fill = "#006DAE") + 
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 0.1, fill = "gray") + 
  annotate("line", x = fn[c(2,4)], y = 1.3, size = 1.3, color = "#C8008F") +
  annotate("segment", x = fn[c(2, 4, 3)], xend = fn[c(2,4, 3)],
           y = c(1.25, 1.25, 0.75), yend = c(1.35, 1.35, 0.9), size = 1.3, color = "#C8008F") +
  annotate("text", x = c(mean(fn[c(2, 4)]), fn[3]), y = c(1.4, 0.7), label = c("IQR", "median"), size = 10, color = "#C8008F") + 
  # some reason vline didn't work
  annotate("segment", x = c(fn[4] + 1.5 * iqr, fn[2] - 1.5 * iqr),  xend = c(fn[4] + 1.5 * iqr, fn[2] - 1.5 * iqr), y = -Inf, yend = Inf, linetype = "dashed") + 
  theme_void()
```


* Observations that are outside the range of lower to upper thresholds are referred at times as .monash-blue[outliers].
* Plotting boxplots for data from a skewed distribution will almost always show these "outliers" but these are not necessary outliers.
* Some definitions of outliers assume a symmetrical population distribution (e.g. in boxplots or observations a certain standard deviations away from the mean) and these definitions are ill-suited for asymmetrical distributions.

# Robust statistics: measure of central tendency

```{r robust-mean, fig.height = 3.5}
df <- tibble(x = rnorm(200) + c(rep(0, each = 195), rep(10, 5)))
ggplot(df, aes(x)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(df$x),
             color = "#EE0220", size = 1.3) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = median(df$x),
             color = "#746FB2", size = 1.3) + 
  theme_void()
```


* **Mean** is a non-robust measure of location. 
* Some robust measures of locations are:
  * **Median** is the 50% quantile of the observations
  * **Trimmed mean** is the sample mean after discarding observations at the tails. 
  * **Winsorized mean** is the sample mean after replacing observations at the tails with the minimum or maximum of the observations that remain.

---

# Robust statistics: measure of dispersion

* **Standard deviation** or its square, **variance*, is a popular choice of measure of dispersion but is not robust to outliers. 
* Standard deviation for sample $x_1, ..., x_n$ is calculated as 
$$\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}}$$
* Interquartile range is the difference between 1st and 3rd quartile and is more robust measure of spread than above.
* Median absolute deviance (MAD) is also more robust and defined as 
$$\text{median}(|x_i - \bar{x}|).$$


---

# Transformations

* Transformations to data are used as an attempt to stabilize the variance or make the data symmetrical.
* Log and square root transformations are popular.
* A range of $\lambda$ values for (one-parameter) Box-Cox transformation is sometimes used to test for optimal transformation:
$$y(\lambda) = \begin{cases}\dfrac{(y^\lambda - 1)}{\lambda}\\ \log(y)\end{cases}$$

* The height distribution of the son appears more normal than of the father looking at the density plot.
* Looking at the Q-Q plots, this however looks the other way around.
* The heights are recorded to five decimal places (e.g. `65.04851`). 
* It's unlikely that the heights were measured to such high precision and rather that someone must have "jittered" the data (i.e. added some small random perturbation to the observation).

* Thre is a large frequency in the final bin.
* There is a decline in observations in the $40-49K range as well as dip in observations around $26K and $34K.
* The histogram is using a bin width of 1 unit and is **left-open** (or **right-closed**): (4.5, 5.5], (5.5, 6.5] ... (49.5, 50.5].
* Occasionally, whether it is left- or right-open can make a difference.

* Density plots depend on the bandwidth chosen and more than often do not estimate well at boundary cases.
* There are various way to present features of the data using a plot and what works for one person, may not be as straightforward for another. 
* Be prepared to do multiple plots.
