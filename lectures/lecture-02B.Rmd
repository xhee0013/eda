You know the median is the middle number. What's a hinge?

There are 13 data values here, provided already sorted.  Write them into  a down-up-down-up pattern, evenly.

# Fences and outside values

- H-spread: difference between the hinges (we would call this Inter-Quartile Range)
- step: 1.5 times H-spread
- inner fences: 1 step outside the hinges
- outer fences: 2 steps outside the hinges
- the value at each end closest to, but still inside the inner fence are "adjacent"
- values between an inner fence and its neighbouring outer fence are "outside"
- values beyond outer fences are "far out"
- these rules produce a SCHEMATIC PLOT

# New statistics: trimeans

The number that comes closest to 

$$\frac{\text{lower hinge} + 2\times \text{median} + \text{upper hinge}}{4}$$
is the **trimean**.

Think about trimmed means, where we might drop  the highest and lowest 5% of observations.

## Box plots are ubiquitous in use today. 

`r emo::ji("dog")` `r emo::ji("cat")` Mostly used to compare distributions, multiple subsets of the data.

Puts the emphasis on the `r anicon::nia("middle 50%", animate="spin", anitype="hover", color="yellow")` of observations, although variations can put emphasis on other aspects.

## Easy re-expression

# Logs, square roots, reciprocals

.pull-left[
What you need to know about logs?
- how to find good enough logs fast and easily
- that equal differences in logs correspond to equal ratios of raw values. .font_small[(This means that wherever you find people using products or ratios-- even in such things as price indexes--using logs--thus converting producers to sums and ratios to differences--is likely to help.)]
]

.pull-right[
The most common transformations are logs, sqrt root, reciprocals, reciprocals of square roots

<center> -1, -1/2, +1/2, +1 </center>

What happened to ZERO?

The small fluctuations in later years are apparently errors or problems with data collection in the Censuses.

No explanation for these fluctuations. (Log didn't linearise, btw.)

# Rules and advice

.pull-left[
.font_medium2[
1.Graphics are friendly.<br>
2.Arithmetic often exists to make graphs possible.<br>
3.Graphs force us to note the unexpected; nothing could be more important.<br>
4.Different graphs show us quite different aspects of the same data.<br>
5.There is no more reason to expect one graph to "tell all" than to expect one number to do the same.<br>
6."Plotting $y$ against $x$" involves significant choices--how we express one or both variables can be crucial.<br>
]]
--

.pull-right[
.font_small[
7.The first step in penetrating plotting is to straighten out the dependence or point scatter as much as reasonable.<br>
8.Plotting $y^2$, $\sqrt{y}$, $log(y)$, $-1/y$ or the like instead of $y$ is one plausible step to take in search of straightness.<br>
9.Plotting $x^2$, $\sqrt{x}$, $log(x)$, $-1/x$ or the like instead of $x$ is another.<br>
10.Once the plot is straightened, we can usually gain much by flattening it, usually by plotting residuals.<br>
11.When plotting scatters, we may need to be careful about how we express $x$ and $y$ in order to avoid concealment by crowding.<br>
